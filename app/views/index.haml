            If you're an [NPR](http://npr.org) listener who uses podcasts,
            you've probably noticed that there are no official podcasts for the
            [Morning Edition](http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/) or
            [All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/)
            NPR radio programs. This is due in a large part to the fact that NPR makes a lot of its money
            from licensing these programs to its member stations (in proportion to
            the number of viewers, which providing an official podcast could
            decrease). NPR does, however, provide
            [an API](http://www.npr.org/api/) that allows access to the content
            of these programs. This site simply rearranges the output of the NPR
            API into a format iTunes can understand. **In case it's not already
            obvious, this site is a personal project that is not affiliated with
            NPR in any way.**

          Because this website essentially circumvents NPR's business decision
          to encourage listeners to tune in to member stations instead of simply
          downloading program content, if you use this site as a complete
          replacememt for your member station, you are essentially hurting your
          local member station's business. **Please don't do that**. This site
          is entirely meant to provide a supplemental way to catch up on programs
          you missed when you aren't near a computer. No matter how you use this
          site, please remember to give to
          [your local member station](http://www.npr.org/stations/) to make it
          possible for these programs to stay on the air.

        :markdown
          Access to data from the NPR API requires an API key. Instead of just
          using mine and pelting NPR with requests for the same key, I've
          designed the site to use a key for each memeber. This means you'll
          need to [get an API key](http://www.npr.org/templates/reg/) from NPR
          (they're free), and enter it in the field below to generate your
          subscription links. Don't worry; the site won't store your key or use
          it for any purpose other than making a request for program content,
          rearranging that content (which it also won't store), and giving it
          to you. If you'd like to see how this all works, check out
          [the source code](https://github.com/jetheis/MissingNPRPodcasts).

      %p
        :markdown
          Once you've got your API key, enter it below to generate your podcast
          links. Remember to read the
          [API terms of use](http://www.npr.org/api/apiterms.php) and make sure
          you're using the output of the NPR API as it was intended (personal,
          noncommercial, etc.).
